Feature: Search
  As a user
  I would like to be able to search for files
  So that I can find needed files quickly

  Background:
    Given user "user0" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And user "user0" has created folder "/just-a-folder"
    And user "user0" has created folder "/फनी näme"
    And user "user0" has created folder "/upload folder"
    And user "user0" has created folder "/upload😀 😁"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/upload.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/a-image.png"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/upload.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/lolol.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/a-image.png"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/uploadÜठिF.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/फनी näme/upload.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/फनी näme/a-image.png"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/upload😀 😁/upload😀 😁.txt"

  Scenario Outline: search for entry by pattern
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "user0" searches for "upload" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the search result should contain these entries:
      | /upload.txt                   |
